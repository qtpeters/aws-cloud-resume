I am foremost a Software Developer. However, I have lead<br/>
Top Skills<br/>
integration, performed DevOps tasks and even spent enough<br/>
Software Engineering<br/>
time on test teams to truly understand and value what they bring<br/>
Java<br/>
to the table. &#160;If I had my way, I would always be doing full stack<br/>
Python<br/>
development work, starting at the data source through the enterprise<br/>layer and all the way to the user interface. &#160;I am currently acting as<br/>
Languages<br/>
the subject matter expert for our overall UI strategy for my section of<br/>
Spanish&#160;(Limited Working)<br/>
the enterprise at Ft. Meade. &#160;This involves developing a system that<br/>
English&#160;(Native or Bilingual)<br/>
will allow several teams working on dozens of web applications to<br/>componentize and share web components and libraries to ultimately<br/>
Certifications<br/>
standardize and unify our user interfaces to simplify maintenance<br/>
ScrumMaster<br/>
and provide continuity for our customer's user experience.<br/>
I enjoy learning and working with new technologies and concepts.<br/>I believe in being a lifelong learner, who uses knowledge to<br/>improve my work, whether it pertains to software development, my<br/>relationships or my hobbies. &#160;My life goal is to become the greatest<br/>version of myself and I will never stop working for that. I thrive on<br/>productivity and thirst for results. I love working collaboratively.<br/>There is nothing more satisfying than attacking a problem or a set of<br/>problems with a good team.<br/>
